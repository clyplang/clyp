# Data Structures Project

Demonstrates comprehensive data structure usage in Clyp.

## Features Demonstrated

- **Lists**: Creation, manipulation, and list comprehensions
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value operations and nested access
- **Nested Structures**: Complex data organization
- **Custom Classes**: Object-oriented data structures
- **Data Transformations**: Processing and converting data

## Data Structures Covered

1. **Lists and Arrays**
   - Basic operations (append, insert)
   - List comprehensions with filtering
   - Iteration and processing

2. **Dictionaries and Objects**
   - Key-value pair management
   - Nested dictionary access
   - Dynamic property addition

3. **Custom Classes**
   - Student class with methods
   - Data encapsulation
   - Computed properties

4. **Complex Transformations**
   - Data aggregation
   - Functional processing
   - Report generation

## Running

```bash
clyp run .
```

## Expected Output

Demonstrates various data structure operations with clear examples of manipulation, transformation, and processing.
